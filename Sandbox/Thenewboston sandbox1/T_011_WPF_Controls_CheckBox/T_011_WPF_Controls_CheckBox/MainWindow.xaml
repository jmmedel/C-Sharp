Let’s create a new WPF project with the name WPFCheckBoxControl.

Drag two checkboxes and two textboxes from a toolbox and set the following properties in the properties window.

Controls	Property	Value
Checkbox1	Content	Two States
Name	checkBox1
Width	90
Checkbox2	Content	Three States
Name	checkBox2

textbox1	Name	textBox1
Width	300
Textbox2	Name	textBox2
Width	300
Now switch to XAML window in which you will see the XAML tags for check boxes and text boxes.

Add some more properties and selection event as shown in the following XAML code.
    
    -->
    <Grid>
        <CheckBox x:Name = "checkBox1" Content = "Two States" HorizontalAlignment = "Left" 
         Margin = "80,70,0,0" VerticalAlignment = "Top" Checked = "HandleCheck" 
         Unchecked = "HandleUnchecked" Width = "90"/>

        <CheckBox x:Name = "checkBox2" Content = "Three States" 
         HorizontalAlignment = "Left" Margin = "80,134,0,0" VerticalAlignment = "Top" 
         Width = "90" IsThreeState = "True" Indeterminate = "HandleThirdState" 
         Checked = "HandleCheck" Unchecked = "HandleUnchecked"/>

        <TextBox x:Name = "textBox1" HorizontalAlignment = "Left" 
         Height = "23" Margin = "236,68,0,0" TextWrapping = "Wrap"
         VerticalAlignment = "Top" Width = "300"/>

        <TextBox x:Name = "textBox2" HorizontalAlignment = "Left"
         Height = "23" Margin = "236,135,0,0" TextWrapping = "Wrap" 
         VerticalAlignment = "Top" Width = "300"/>
    </Grid>
</Window>
