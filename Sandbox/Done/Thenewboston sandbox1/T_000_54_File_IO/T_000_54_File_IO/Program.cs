    C# - File I/O
     
    A file is a collection of data stored in a disk with a specific name and a directory path. When a file is opened for reading or writing, it becomes a stream.

The stream is basically the sequence of bytes passing through the communication path. There are two main streams: the input stream and the output stream. The input stream is used for reading data from file (read operation) and the output stream is used for writing into the file (write operation).

C# I/O Classes
The System.IO namespace has various classes that are used for performing numerous operations with files, such as creating and deleting files, reading from or writing to a file, closing a file etc.

The following table shows some commonly used non-abstract classes in the System.IO namespace −

Sr.No.	I/O Class & Description
1	
BinaryReader

Reads primitive data from a binary stream.

2	
BinaryWriter

Writes primitive data in binary format.

3	
BufferedStream

A temporary storage for a stream of bytes.

4	
Directory

Helps in manipulating a directory structure.

5	
DirectoryInfo

Used for performing operations on directories.

6	
DriveInfo

Provides information for the drives.

7	
File

Helps in manipulating files.

8	
FileInfo

Used for performing operations on files.

9	
FileStream

Used to read from and write to any location in a file.

10	
MemoryStream

Used for random access to streamed data stored in memory.

11	
Path

Performs operations on path information.

12	
StreamReader

Used for reading characters from a byte stream.

13	
StreamWriter

Is used for writing characters to a stream.

14	
StringReader

Is used for reading from a string buffer.

15	
StringWriter

Is used for writing into a string buffer.


    The FileStream Class
The FileStream class in the System.IO namespace helps in reading from, writing to and closing files. This class derives from the abstract class Stream.

You need to create a FileStream object to create a new file or open an existing file. The syntax for creating a FileStream object is as follows −

FileStream <object_name> = new FileStream( <file_name>, <FileMode Enumerator>,
   <FileAccess Enumerator>, <FileShare Enumerator>);
For example, we create a FileStream object F for reading a file named sample.txt as shown −

FileStream F = new FileStream("sample.txt", FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read,
   FileShare.Read);
Sr.No.	Parameter & Description
1	
FileMode

The FileMode enumerator defines various methods for opening files. The members of the FileMode enumerator are −

Append − It opens an existing file and puts cursor at the end of file, or creates the file, if the file does not exist.

Create − It creates a new file.

CreateNew − It specifies to the operating system, that it should create a new file.

Open − It opens an existing file.

OpenOrCreate − It specifies to the operating system that it should open a file if it exists, otherwise it should create a new file.

Truncate − It opens an existing file and truncates its size to zero bytes.

2	
FileAccess

FileAccess enumerators have members: Read, ReadWrite and Write.

3	
FileShare

FileShare enumerators have the following members −

Inheritable − It allows a file handle to pass inheritance to the child processes

None − It declines sharing of the current file

Read − It allows opening the file for readin.

ReadWrite − It allows opening the file for reading and writing

Write − It allows opening the file for writing

            {
                Console.Write(F.ReadByte() + " ");
