Example
Let’s create a new WPF project with the name WPFImageControl.

First divide the screen into two rows by using Grid.RowDefinition.

Drag three Image controls from the Toolbox.

The following example shows three images. The first one is a simple image; in the second image, opacity property is set; and in the third image, one Eclipse is painted with an ImageBrush.

The XAML code is as follows −
    
    -->
    <Grid>
        <Grid.RowDefinitions>
            <RowDefinition Height = "1*"/>
            <RowDefinition Height = "1*"/>
        </Grid.RowDefinitions>

        <StackPanel Orientation = "Horizontal">
            <Image Width = "200" Source = "C:\Users\kagaya\Desktop\Git\T_016_WPF_IMAGE\T_016_WPF_IMAGE\Image\download.jpg"  
            VerticalAlignment = "Top" Margin = "30"/>
            <Image Width = "200" Source = "C:\Users\kagaya\Desktop\Git\T_016_WPF_IMAGE\T_016_WPF_IMAGE\Image\download.jpg" VerticalAlignment = "Top"
            Margin = "30" Opacity = "0.5"/>
        </StackPanel>

        <StackPanel Grid.Row = "1">
            <Ellipse Height = "100" Width = "200" HorizontalAlignment = "Center" Margin = "30">
                <Ellipse.Fill>
                    <ImageBrush ImageSource = "C:\Users\kagaya\Desktop\Git\T_016_WPF_IMAGE\T_016_WPF_IMAGE\Image\download.jpg" />
                </Ellipse.Fill>
            </Ellipse>
        </StackPanel>
    </Grid>
</Window>
