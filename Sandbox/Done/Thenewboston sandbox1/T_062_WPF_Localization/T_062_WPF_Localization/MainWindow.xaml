    WPF - Localization
    Localization is the translation of application resources into localized versions for the specific cultures that the application supports.

When you develop your application and your application is available in only one language, then you are limiting the number of your customers and the size of your business. If you want to increase your customer base which will also increase your business, then your product must be available and reachable to a global audience. Cost-effective localization of your product is one of the best and most economical ways to reach out to more customers.

In WPF, localizable applications are very easy to create with resx file which is the simplest solution for localization. Let’s take a simple example to understand how it works −

Create a new WPF project with the name WPFLocalization.

In your solution explorer, you will see the Resources.resx file under Properties folder.
