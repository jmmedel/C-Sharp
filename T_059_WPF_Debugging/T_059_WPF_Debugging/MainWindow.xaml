    WPF - Debugging
    It is a systematic mechanism of identifying and fixing the bugs or defects in a piece of code which are not behaving the same as you are expecting. Debugging a complex application where the subsystems are tightly coupled are not that easy, because fixing bugs in one subsystem can create bugs in another subsystem.

Debugging in C#
In WPF applications, programmers deal with two languages such as C# and XAML. If you are familiar with debugging in any procedural language such as C# or C/C++ and you also know the usage of break points, then you can debug the C# part of your application easily.

Let’s take a simple example to demonstrate how to debug a C# code. Create a new WPF project with the name WPFDebuggingDemo. Drag four labels, three textboxes, and one button from the toolbox. Take a look at the following XAML code.
    -->

    <Grid>
        <TextBox Height = "23" Margin = "0,44,169,0" Name = "textBox1"  
         VerticalAlignment = "Top" HorizontalAlignment = "Right" Width = "120" />

        <TextBox Height = "23" Margin = "0,99,169,0" Name = "textBox2"  
         VerticalAlignment = "Top" HorizontalAlignment = "Right" Width = "120" />

        <TextBox HorizontalAlignment = "Right" Margin = "0,153,169,0"  
         Name = "textBox3" Width = "120" Height = "23" VerticalAlignment = "Top" />

        <Label Height = "28" Margin = "117,42,0,0" Name = "label1"  
         VerticalAlignment = "Top" HorizontalAlignment = "Left" Width = "120">
            Item 1</Label>

        <Label Height = "28" HorizontalAlignment = "Left"  
         Margin = "117,99,0,0" Name = "label2" VerticalAlignment = "Top" Width = "120">
            Item 2</Label>

        <Label HorizontalAlignment = "Left" Margin = "117,153,0,181"  
         Name = "label3" Width = "120">Item 3</Label>

        <Button Height = "23" HorizontalAlignment = "Right" Margin = "0,0,214,80"
         Name = "button1" VerticalAlignment = "Bottom" Width = "75"  
         Click = "button1_Click">Total</Button>

        <Label Height = "28" HorizontalAlignment = "Right"  
         Margin = "0,0,169,66" Name = "label4" VerticalAlignment = "Bottom" Width = "120"/>

    </Grid>

</Window>
