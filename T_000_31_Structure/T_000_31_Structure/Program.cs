    C# - Structures
    In C#, a structure is a value type data type. It helps you to make a single variable hold related data of various data types. The struct keyword is used for creating a structure.

Structures are used to represent a record. Suppose you want to keep track of your books in a library. You might want to track the following attributes about each book −

Title
Author
Subject
Book ID
Defining a Structure
To define a structure, you must use the struct statement. The struct statement defines a new data type, with more than one member for your program.

For example, here is the way you can declare the Book structure −

struct Books {
   public string title;
   public string author;
   public string subject;
   public int book_id;
};  
The following program shows the use of the structure −
 */
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Books Book1;   /* Declare Book1 of type Book */
            Books Book2;   /* Declare Book2 of type Book */

            /* book 1 specification */
            Book1.title = "C Programming";
            Book1.author = "Nuha Ali";
            Book1.subject = "C Programming Tutorial";
            Book1.book_id = 6495407;

            /* book 2 specification */
            Book2.title = "Telecom Billing";
            Book2.author = "Zara Ali";
            Book2.subject = "Telecom Billing Tutorial";
            Book2.book_id = 6495700;

            /* print Book1 info */
            Console.WriteLine("Book 1 title : {0}", Book1.title);
            Console.WriteLine("Book 1 author : {0}", Book1.author);
            Console.WriteLine("Book 1 subject : {0}", Book1.subject);
            Console.WriteLine("Book 1 book_id :{0}", Book1.book_id);

            /* print Book2 info */
            Console.WriteLine("Book 2 title : {0}", Book2.title);
            Console.WriteLine("Book 2 author : {0}", Book2.author);
            Console.WriteLine("Book 2 subject : {0}", Book2.subject);
            Console.WriteLine("Book 2 book_id : {0}", Book2.book_id);

            Book Book3 = new Book();   /* Declare Book1 of type Book */
            Book Book4 = new Book();   /* Declare Book2 of type Book */

            /* book 1 specification */
            Book3.getValues("C Programming",
            "Nuha Ali", "C Programming Tutorial", 6495407);

            /* book 2 specification */
            Book4.getValues("Telecom Billing",
            "Zara Ali", "Telecom Billing Tutorial", 6495700);

            /* print Book1 info */
            Book3.display();

            /* print Book2 info */
            Book4.display();


            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }

     Features of C# Structures
You have already used a simple structure named Books. Structures in C# are quite different from that in traditional C or C++. The C# structures have the following features −

Structures can have methods, fields, indexers, properties, operator methods, and events.

Structures can have defined constructors, but not destructors. However, you cannot define a default constructor for a structure. The default constructor is automatically defined and cannot be changed.

Unlike classes, structures cannot inherit other structures or classes.

Structures cannot be used as a base for other structures or classes.

A structure can implement one or more interfaces.

Structure members cannot be specified as abstract, virtual, or protected.

When you create a struct object using the New operator, it gets created and the appropriate constructor is called. Unlike classes, structs can be instantiated without using the New operator.

If the New operator is not used, the fields remain unassigned and the object cannot be used until all the fields are initialized.

Class versus Structure
Classes and Structures have the following basic differences −

classes are reference types and structs are value types
structures do not support inheritance
structures cannot have default constructor
In the light of the above discussions, let us rewrite the previous example −
         
    */
    struct Books
    {
        public string title;
        public string author;
        public string subject;
        public int book_id;
    };

    struct Book
    {
        private string title;
        private string author;
        private string  subject;
        private int book_id;

        public void getValues(string t, string a, string s, int id)
        {
            title = t;
            author = a;
            subject = s;
            book_id = id;
        }

        public void display()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Title : {0}", title);
            Console.WriteLine("Author : {0}", author);
            Console.WriteLine("Subject : {0}", subject);
            Console.WriteLine("Book_id :{0}", book_id);
        }
    }
}
