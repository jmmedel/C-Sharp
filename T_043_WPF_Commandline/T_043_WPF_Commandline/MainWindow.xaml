    WPF - Command Line
    Command line argument is a mechanism where a user can pass a set of parameters or values to a WPF application when it is executed. These arguments are very important to control an application from outside, for example, if you want to open a Word document from the command prompt, then you can use this command “C:\> start winword word1.docx” and it will open word1.docx document.

Command line arguments are handled in Startup function. Following is a simple example which shows how to pass command line arguments to a WPF application. Let’s create a new WPF application with the name WPFCommandLine.

Drag one textbox from the toolbox to the design window.

In this example, we will pass a txt file path to our application as command line parameter.

The program will read the txt file and then write all the text on the text box.

The following XAML code creates a textbox and initializes it with some properties.
    
    -->

    <Grid>
        <TextBox x:Name = "textBox" HorizontalAlignment = "Left"  
         Height = "180" Margin = "100" TextWrapping = "Wrap" 
         VerticalAlignment = "Top" Width = "300"/>
    </Grid>

</Window>
