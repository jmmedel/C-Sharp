    WPF - Mouse
    There are different types of mouse inputs such as MouseDown, MouseEnter, MouseLeave, etc. In the following example, we will handle some of the mouse inputs.

Let’s create a new WPF project with the name WPFMouseInput.

Drag a rectangle and three Text blocks to a stack panel and set the following properties and events as shown in the following XAML file.
    
    -->
    <StackPanel>
        <Rectangle x:Name = "mrRec" Fill = "AliceBlue" 
         MouseEnter = "OnMouseEnter" MouseLeave = "OnMouseLeave"  
         MouseMove = "OnMouseMove" MouseDown = "OnMouseDown" Height = "100" Margin = "20">
        </Rectangle>

        <TextBlock x:Name = "txt1" Height = "31" HorizontalAlignment = "Right" 
         Width = "250" Margin = "0,0,294,0" />
        <TextBlock x:Name = "txt2" Height = "31" HorizontalAlignment = "Right"  
         Width = "250" Margin = "0,0,294,0" />
        <TextBlock x:Name = "txt3" Height = "31" HorizontalAlignment = "Right"  
         Width = "250" Margin = "0,0,294,0" />

    </StackPanel>
    
</Window>
