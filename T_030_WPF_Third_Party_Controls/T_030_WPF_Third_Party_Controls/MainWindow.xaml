    WPF - Third Party Controls
    Third-party controls are those which are not created by Microsoft but are created by some individual or company by using WPF User Control or Custom Control. Telerik and DevExpress are the most popular companies for creating third-party controls.

In this chapter, we will be using Telerik controls. So let’s start by following the steps given below.

Go to the link Telerik which contains the Telerik WPF controls and download the UI for WPF.

Once the download is complete, install the files on your machine.

After the installation, open Visual Studio and create a new WPF project with the name WPF3rdPartyControls.

On Toolbox, you will see the Telerik UI controls. In addition, you will observe that in solution explorer, all the required dll are also added after installation.
